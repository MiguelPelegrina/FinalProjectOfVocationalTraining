# FinalProjectOfVocationalTraining

The following project is part of my vocational training and required for finishing it. The idea behind this application is to offer an easy way of managing the household's food storage. Especially if an household has many members, managing it can become increasingly difficult. Therefore, this app is a tool that considers, among others, the following use cases: 
  - Different storages can be created and shared between users.
  - Stored products can be seen, added, removed or modified. They can also be used to cook recipes. 
  - Users can elaborate recipes to share them with others.
  - Shopping lists, that are shared with the other users of the storage, can be made as well.
  - A calendar allows the user to specify certain recipes for a concrete day.
  - All storages, products, recipes and shopping lists can be manipulated (CRUD).

All use cases are intended to be as easy, flexible and intuitive as possible, e.g. creating a shopping list for a specific recipe or day or checking which recipes are currently available considering the content of the storage.
